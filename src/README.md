# react-parcel
My personal React + Parcel set up

## Quick Overview
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

This will run tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.
